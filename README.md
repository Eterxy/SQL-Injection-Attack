# SQL-Injection-Attack

This is a project done to showcase an SQL injection attack without any defenses implemented to express the danger of SQL vulnerabilities as it allows the attacker to retreive sensitive data.
This is considereably dangerous as the attacker can create a new account that will be added to the SQL database and then use that newly created account to conduct an SQLi attack to retreive data on the database table.

This project will also showcase the end result once ample defenses/detection algorithms are implemented into the website preventing SQLi attacks from being performed on that website.
